OPERATORS (WITH IMPACTFUL ANSWERS)
1️⃣ Difference between = and ==

Smart Answer:
“= is an assignment operator used to store a value in a variable, while == is a comparison operator that checks whether two values are equal. In interviews, I remember it as assign vs compare.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

2️⃣ Difference between == and === (JavaScript)

Smart Answer:
“== compares only values, whereas === compares both value and data type. In professional coding, we prefer === to avoid unexpected type conversion bugs.”

📌 Asked in: Accenture, Amazon

3️⃣ Pre-increment vs Post-increment

Smart Answer:
“In pre-increment (++i), the value is increased first and then used. In post-increment (i++), the value is used first and then increased. This difference matters a lot inside expressions.”

📌 Asked in: Capgemini, Cognizant

4️⃣ Operator precedence

Smart Answer:
“Operator precedence decides which operation is executed first in an expression. If precedence is unclear, I always use parentheses to improve readability and avoid logical errors.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, IBM

5️⃣ Short-circuit evaluation

Smart Answer:
“In logical operators like && and ||, evaluation stops as soon as the result is known. This improves performance and also prevents runtime errors.”

📌 Asked in: IBM, Accenture

6️⃣ Ternary operator vs if-else

Smart Answer:
“The ternary operator is best for simple, single-condition decisions because it makes the code concise. For complex logic, if-else is more readable.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, Capgemini

7️⃣ Logical vs Bitwise operators

Smart Answer:
“Logical operators work on boolean conditions, while bitwise operators work on binary bits. Bitwise operators are mainly used in low-level and performance-critical applications.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

8️⃣ Bitwise operator usage

Smart Answer:
“Bitwise operators are used in areas like encryption, compression, and embedded systems where performance and memory efficiency matter.”

📌 Asked in: Cognizant, IBM

9️⃣ Implicit vs Explicit type casting

Smart Answer:
“Implicit casting is done automatically by the compiler, while explicit casting is done manually by the programmer when data loss is possible.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, Accenture

🔟 Arithmetic operators on characters

Smart Answer:
“Yes, because characters are stored as ASCII values. Performing arithmetic operations actually works on those numeric values.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

🔹 CONTROL STRUCTURES
1️⃣ What are control structures?

Smart Answer:
“Control structures define the flow of execution in a program. They decide what runs, when it runs, and how many times it runs.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Infosys

2️⃣ Types of control structures

Smart Answer:
“There are three main types: sequential, decision, and looping. Together, they help design logical and efficient programs.”

📌 Asked in: Wipro, Capgemini

3️⃣ Sequential vs Decision control

Smart Answer:
“Sequential control executes code line by line, while decision control chooses different paths based on conditions.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, Accenture

4️⃣ Decision vs Looping control

Smart Answer:
“Decision control selects a path once, whereas looping control repeats a block until a condition is met.”

📌 Asked in: Cognizant, IBM

5️⃣ Why goto is avoided?

Smart Answer:
“goto makes code hard to read and maintain. Modern programming focuses on structured and readable flow control.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, IBM

6️⃣ Role of control structures

Smart Answer:
“They make programs flexible, readable, and efficient by controlling execution flow logically.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

7️⃣ Nested control structures

Smart Answer:
“When one control structure is placed inside another, it’s called nesting. It’s useful but should be limited for readability.”

📌 Asked in: Capgemini, Accenture

8️⃣ break, continue, return

Smart Answer:
“break exits a loop, continue skips the current iteration, and return exits a function.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Capgemini

9️⃣ Exception handling as control

Smart Answer:
“Exception handling controls abnormal flow and prevents program crashes.”

📌 Asked in: IBM, Cognizant

🔟 Readability improvement

Smart Answer:
“Using proper control structures improves code readability and reduces maintenance cost.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, Accenture

🔹 LOOPS (HIGH-IMPACT ANSWERS)
1️⃣ for vs while vs do-while

Smart Answer:
“for is best when iterations are known, while when conditions matter, and do-while when execution is required at least once.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Infosys, Wipro

2️⃣ Entry vs Exit controlled

Smart Answer:
“Entry-controlled loops check conditions before execution, while exit-controlled loops check after executing once.”

📌 Asked in: Accenture, Cognizant

3️⃣ Infinite loop

Smart Answer:
“An infinite loop occurs when the condition never becomes false, often due to logical errors.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

4️⃣ break & continue in loops

Smart Answer:
“They give better control inside loops—break stops the loop, continue skips iterations.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, IBM

5️⃣ Nested loops & complexity

Smart Answer:
“Nested loops increase time complexity significantly, so they should be optimized carefully.”

📌 Asked in: Amazon, Accenture

6️⃣ Loop vs Recursion

Smart Answer:
“Loops use iteration, recursion uses function calls. Loops are generally more memory-efficient.”

📌 Asked in: Cognizant, IBM

7️⃣ For-each vs for loop

Smart Answer:
“For-each is simpler and safer when accessing all elements, while for gives more control.”

📌 Asked in: Capgemini, Accenture

8️⃣ Common loop errors

Smart Answer:
“Wrong conditions and missing updates are common mistakes leading to infinite loops.”

📌 Asked in: TCS, Wipro

9️⃣ Best loop when iterations unknown

Smart Answer:
“When iterations are unknown, while loop is preferred.”

📌 Asked in: Infosys, Cognizant

🔟 do-while usage

Smart Answer:
“do-while is useful when the loop must execute at least once, like menu-driven programs.”

📌 Asked in: Capgemini, Infosys
